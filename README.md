### General Notes

- It is possible to manually write all of our database code, including manually writing SQL commands to execute, but it is
much easier and safer to use a library which abstracts over the database. Sequelize is one of the most popular JavaScript (and hence TypeScript) libraries for connecting to databases.

- A connection string is what it sounds like: a string which tells a database library how to connect to a particular database or server. These come in all shapes and sizes, depending on which kind of database weâ€™re connecting to. You can find handy reference for many different types of connection string at ConnectionStrings.com
